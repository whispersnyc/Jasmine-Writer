# Jasmine Writer

This AI-generated project does two things:
- converts my data/ folder into a viewable format for my Kobo ereader and syncs with it via sftp
    - epubs stay as-is
    - md files are converted to epubs, seperated by markdown headings
- dead-simple webapp for typing or copy/pasting long-form text to read without distraction, alternative to zenpen.io
    - zenpen's font was too large, page width was small
    - title, prewritten text, misspelling underlines, highlight menu

Plan is to connect the two concepts into a frontend to type as well as display AoH's writing in an aesthetic manner
